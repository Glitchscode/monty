# Stacks, Queues - LIFO, FIFO
This project is based on the implementation and exploration of stacks and queues, specifically focusing on the concepts of Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) and First-In-First-Out (FIFO) data structures in the C programming language.

## Motivation
This project is a component of the ALX Hoberton Software Engineering Program, serving as an academic endeavor with a specific focus on stacks and queues.

## Coding style
The coding style of the functions adhere to the Betty style. The Betty style is a set of guidelines for writing clean and consistent code in the C programming language.

## Features
Stack Implementation
Queue Implementation
Error Handling
Flexibility

## How to Use
Start by cloning this repository to your computer or simply download the zip file from this repository. Navigate to the directory containing your code and then use this command to compile the code:
$ gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=c89 *.c -o monty
After successful compilation, execute the program using: ./monty

To ensure that error messages are printed on stderr, you can use the appropriate error handling technique in your code.
